//Write a C++ program to perform different operations based on the choice (menu-like behavior):
//In case the user selects option 1 - ask the user to enter year of birth.
//In case the user selects option 2 - calculate how old the user is (if the user entered value; if not, ask the user to enter year of birth).
//In case the user selects option 3 - the program will inform the user if the user is old or not (OLD users are the one who have more than 40 years).
